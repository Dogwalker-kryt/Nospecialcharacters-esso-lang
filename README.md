# Nospecialcharacters-esso-lang
- Basicly Python but with no special characters
- in the lexer.c file you can see al names of all symbols

**about**
- Every Special character
- , . ; : ( ) / [ ] = ! - _ * + # ' and so on
- is reaplaced with the name of the charakter in caps
- so
   "print("Hello world")"
- is going to:
   "print BRACKET QUOT Hello world QUOT BRACKET"
  
## Still in Progress!
- Compiler is finished it searches for main.nsc (nsc = no special character)
- in the main.nsc file you can find the "Hello, World!" program
  
## Compiler
- Still has many many issues
